<div>
	This area is used to define the branch mappings of Git branches to ISPW
	levels. Each mapping has three possible fields which should be
	separated by commas.
	<ol>
		<li>The first field is a Git branch to ISPW level mapping which
			supports wildcarding (example: **/dev1 => DEV1, **/dev2 => DEV2,
			etc.)
		<li>The second field indicates how often to create an assignment
			to load the changes in ISPW. <br>The possible values are
			<ul>
				<li>per-commit: an assignment will be created for each commit.</li>
				<li>per-branch: an assignment will be created for each Git
					branch. If an assignment already exists for a Git branch, it will
					be reused.</li>
				<li>custom: an assignment with the given custom description
					will be created for this branch mapping. If an assignment with this
					description already exists, it will be reused. When "custom" is
					specified, the user must specify the third field.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>The third field indicates the custom assignment description
			to use when loading changes into an assignment. <br>This field
			is only required if "custom" was specified in the second field.
	</ol>
